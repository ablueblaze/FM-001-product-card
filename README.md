## Overview

The project went pretty smoothly. Considering this is just a static component with no complicated elements I was expecting to fly through this. 

Total work time for this project was 5 hours. Though part of that was just organizing and reading through all the template stuff for Frontend mentor.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process
  - General Review of project
    For this project, there wasn't a lot to review. It's a simple static card that needs to be responsive. 

  -Basic plan
    I sketched out the layout to lock the idea in my head, made up a project_guide, then built out the HTML. 
    Once the HTML was in place, and I verified that it looked good I dived into the CSS with a mobile first approach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mostly this was review for me. Though I always count practice with CSS as a major boon to my continued learning. CSS just doesn't click in my head all that well, so stuff like this is great!

### Continued development

My idea to add some continued development for this project was to make all the class names as generic as possible. 

For example, instead of perfume-name I used product-name. Should help with the continued use in the future.
